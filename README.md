# Little-Lemon-Django-Project
Welcome to the Little Lemon Django Project! This is a web application built with Django framework for the Little Lemon restaurant, a charming neighborhood bistro. The project aims to transition the restaurant's one-page website into a dynamic, database-driven application, allowing managers to easily update menu information and providing a seamless user experience.

## Features
* Home, About, and Booking pages to provide information about the restaurant and allow customers to make reservations.
* Menu page that displays the restaurant's locally sourced menu with daily specials.
* Database integration to store and update menu items, including details like name, description, price, and photo.
* Dedicated menu item pages that load when users click on a specific menu item.
## Technologies Used
* Django: a powerful Python web framework for building scalable and maintainable web applications.
* HTML and CSS: for creating the website's user interface and styling.
* SQLite: a lightweight and easy-to-use database management system.
